### Detailed List of Changes

#### Definitions modified for 3 concepts:

| Concept URI | PrefLabel | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/221    |  Chandrasekhar limit  |  A limiting mass of about 1.44 Solar masses that the theory predicts a non-rotating white dwarf can attain without collapsing to become a neutron star or a black hole. Over this critical mass, the degeneracy pressure will be unable to bear the load of the bulk mass.    |
| http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/719    |  Henry Draper catalog     |  A catalog of stars in which every star is classified by its stellar spectrum. This system is named for the astronomer Henry Draper, but was cataloged by Annie J. Cannon (225,300 stars), and later extended by Margaret W. Mayall.  |
| http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/2045   |  Schonberg-Chandrasekhar limit    |  During the main sequence stage, a star burns the hydrogen in its core and transforms it into helium. When the helium mass amounts to about 10% of the initial stellar mass, the star can no longer maintain the hydrostatic equilibrium in its core; the star increases its volume and leaves the main sequence in order to become a red giant.  |


#### Removed alternate labels from 3 concepts:

| Concept URI | PrefLabel | Removed AltLabels |

| http://astrothesaurus.org/uat/1469   |  Small Solar System bodies    |  Minor planets    |


#### Removed defintion from 1 concept:
